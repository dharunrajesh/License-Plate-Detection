License Plate Detection From a Real Time Video

Steps to Implement:
Capture Real-Time Video
Use OpenCV to capture video from a webcam or external source.

Detect License Plates

Use YOLO, Haar Cascades, or OpenCVâ€™s built-in object detection methods to detect the plate.
Alternatively, use a deep learning model like YOLOv8 or SSD for more accuracy.
Preprocess the Plate Image

Convert to grayscale.
Apply adaptive thresholding and noise reduction.
Apply OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Use Tesseract OCR to extract characters from the detected plate.
Optionally, use EasyOCR or PaddleOCR for better accuracy.
Display or Store the Result

Show the detected plate and extracted text on the screen.
Save it in a database or log file.
